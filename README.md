## GMU-CYSE-Capstone-2020-21

### 1.0 Executive Summary 

This Request for Proposal (RFP) is focused on Anomaly Detection Analysis.   

### 2.0 Objectives 

Anomaly detection analysis is the subject of the proposed project. The desired deliverable is an integrated product that includes 
 1. algorithm for analyzing relevant data, 
 2. dashboard for visualization of the analytic results, 
 3. modeling documentation and user manual, 
 4. technical demo of the integrated capability. 

Dashboard, the primary output for this project, should have the capability to display the following: 
- Raw data input  
- Visualizations for the output 
- Capability to trigger alerts for a SOC analyst with a follow up action (i.e. analytic results to include recommended mitigations, e.g. close the port, disable the user account, quarantine the server, etc.) 

 
Prerequisites: 

- Knowledge of supervised (unsupervised preferred) machine learning  
- Knowledge of Log Analysis and time series data 
- Knowledge of basic software application with web-server front end and database back-end 
- Knowledge of basic network traffic analysis 


Students must be familiar with the principles of IT Operations and Security Analytics. Experience with log time series data in an operational setting is desired but not required.  Students should have a strong desire to learn how to safely and effectively conduct threat monitoring or threat hunting in the cloud and the role of machine learning. 

CISA team jointly with Elastic will provide all supporting documentation to bring the team up to speed on Elastic capabilities necessary for the project, but student team must establish and manage a student Elastic Cloud account.   

CISA technical SME will provide input on a starting dataset to seed the capstone research. However, it is anticipated the students will enrich their learning experience by seeking additional publicly available datasets or creating their own log files for analysis.  

### 3.0 Statement of Work / Requirements 

In order to develop the integrated dashboard for anomaly detection analysis, the team will perform the following: 

**Task 1** 

Find the following public datasets (or generate it from the built environment described below): 
- Outside the network looking for suspicious connections  
  - HTTP Proxy Logs (any open source proxy, students can choose) 
  - DNS Logs 
  - Netflow Logs 
- Inside the network looking for suspicious connections  
  - HTTP Proxy Logs (any open source proxy, students can choose) 
  - DNS Logs 
  - Netflow LogsLDAP logs (active directory) to let know which servers and users are behaving suspiciously 
  - CPU metrics logs to be combined with LDAP logs to validate suspicious behavior 
- Any other datasets that can support anomaly detection  

Potential sources for the datasets are:  
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/microsoft-malware-prediction 
- https://digitalcorpora.org/ 
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets  

Please also explore the content of the DHS S&T project IMPACT: 
- https://www.dhs.gov/csd-impact, specifically https://ImpactCyberTrust.org/search.  

**Task 2**

- Build environment using Elastic Cloud (SaaS) is preferred.   
- Students will be provisioned student accounts to an Elastic cloud instance (Cloud UI).   
- Students will create a deployment for an Elastic Stack in their Elastic Cloud instance.  
- Students will select a cloud platform to host their deployment (AWS is preferred).  No additional cloud accounts required. 
- Students will select a region where their deployments will be hosted (cloud platform). 
- Students will pick a version of Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch cluster, Kibana, Beats and Logstash) or restore from a previous snapshot. 
- Students will add additional features; Machine Learning. 
- Students will utilize the following analytics software: 
   - Kibana visualizations and dashboards.  
   - Anomaly Explorer in Kibana  
   - Machine Learning in the Elastic Stack  
- Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash and Machine Learning in the Elastic Stack will serve as a starting point to support basic research at the beginning of the project.  

**Task 3**

- Ingest time series data into Elasticsearch indexes.   
- Students will utilize a combination of the following tools for data ingest: 
   - Kibana Dev Tools Console is the perfect fit for development and debugging.  
   - Elasticsearch Ingest Pipelines, Elasticsearch REST API or Elastic Search (ES) Python API scripts.  
   - Elastic Beats comes with Elastic. It is a set of lightweight data shippers that allow to conveniently send data to Elasticsearch Service.          Packaged with the Beats are modules that provide the configuration for data acquisition, parsing, indexing, and visualization for many common      databases, operating systems, container environments, web servers, caches, and so on. These modules provide a five-minute data-to-dashboard        experience.  
   - Logstash comes with Elastic. Logstash is a powerful and flexible tool to read, process, and ship data of any kind.   A common architectural        pattern is to combine Beats and Logstash: use Beats to collect data and use Logstash to perform any data processing that Beats are not            capable of doing. 
 - Students will define index templates with settings and mappings for the data attributes to be ingested.    

**Task 4**

- Build the dashboard in Kibana. 
- Design and implement data visualization(s). 
  - Add index patterns to Kibana
  - Add visualizations to Kibana and identify the best way to view results (Ex: Cluster graphs)  

**Task 5**

- Use anomaly detection to analyze time series data by creating accurate baselines of normal behavior and identifying anomalous patterns in your     dataset. Data is pulled from Elasticsearch for analysis and anomaly results are displayed in Kibana dashboards. 
- Create anomaly detection jobs to analyze datasets.   
- Use Anomaly Explorer and Single Metric Viewer to display results of anomaly detection jobs. 
- Separate operations datasets and security datasets.  Analyze machine learning (anomaly detection) results.  Find examples where you can you gain   deeper insights. 
  - Operations datasets: Elastic’s machine learning currently is focused on providing added value to time series data such as log files,               application metrics, system performance metrics, network flows, and other transactional data that can be collected and stored in                   Elasticsearch.  The key to getting good information is building a model of key indicators that occur with regularity throughout a data set.       When working with log data, some examples of regularly occurring key indicators would be HTTP status codes in Apache or Nginx web server           messages, or message codes in Cisco IOS messages. These key indicators occur regularly enough to be trended over a time period for the number     of times they occur. Metrics for memory utilization or duration counters are another example of regularly occurring key indicators. These         numerical fields can be averaged over a period of time so that the machine learning algorithms can model. It is best to use indicators that       stay fairly constant from one time period to the next, so it is important not to make the time period too small, where the indicators could       change significantly over a time interval. 
  - Security datasets: While threshold-based event notification is powerful, such as triggering a notification when a successful login is preceded     by multiple unsuccessful logins, the ability to automate the detection of anomalous behavior without having to define specific data conditions     simplifies the experience for the security analyst. That said, as we mentioned above, we're talking about mathematics, not magic, so the           machine learning engine must be given its marching orders as settings in its job configuration. Since the engine can model any type of time-       series data - numerical or categorical - the types of machine learning jobs that can be configured are unlimited. While this is flexible, it       can be a bit too much for a security analyst who really just wants to find threats. Here we introduce the concept of machine learning             "recipes" for security use cases. Recipes describe how to configure machine learning jobs, so that we can use automated anomaly detection to       uncover elementary attack behaviors that can be difficult to detect using other means. Elementary attack behaviors include activities such as     DNS tunneling, web data exfiltration, suspicious endpoint process execution, and more. 

**Task 6** 
- Design and implement “Alerts and Recommended Actions” capability: 
- Capability to map analytic results to mitigations or trigger alerts on the Kibana dashboard
